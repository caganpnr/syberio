                    <p><b>What is Private Key?</b><br></br><br></br></p><p>A private key is a piece of information that is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted using the corresponding public key. Private keys are used in public key cryptography to secure communication over the internet. In a public key system, each user has a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data that is intended for the owner of the private key, while the private key is used to decrypt the data. This allows the owner of the private key to receive secure communication from other users without having to share a secret key with them. The private key is kept secret and must be protected, as anyone with access to it can decrypt the data that has been encrypted with the corresponding public key.</p>

                                <p>To create a public and private key pair in your terminal, you will need to use a tool called <b>ssh-keygen</b>. This is a standard tool that is included with most Unix-based operating systems, including Linux and macOS.</p>
                                <br></br>
                                <p>To generate a new key pair, open a terminal window and enter the following command:</p>
                                <br></br>
                                <Card>

                                        <Text>ssh-keygen -t rsa</Text>
                                    </CardBody>
                                </Card>
                                <br></br>
                                <p>This will create a new RSA key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key. By default, the private key will be stored in a file named id_rsa in your ~/.ssh directory, and the public key will be stored in a file named id_rsa.pub in the same directory.</p>
                                <br></br>
                                <p>You can specify a different location for the key files by using the -f option, like this:</p>
                                <br></br>
                                <Card>
                                    <CardBody color={"white"} backgroundColor={"black"}>
                                        <Text>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /path/to/keyfile</Text>
                                    </CardBody>

                                <p>You will be prompted to enter a passphrase for your private key. This is an optional security measure that can help protect your key if it is stolen or otherwise compromised. If you do not want to use a passphrase, simply press Enter when prompted.</p>
                                <br></br>
                                <p>Once the key pair has been generated, you can use the id_rsa.pub file as your public key, and the id_rsa file as your private key.</p>
